### Job Skill type

Cortex skill that runs a background job.

#### Prerequisites
* `cortex-cli`
* `Docker`

#### Files generated
* `skill.yaml` Skill definition
* `main.py` Python3 code implementing job's business logic
* `requirements.txt` Python3 libraries dependencies
* `Dockerfile` to build Docker image for this skill

#### Steps to build and deploy

Set environment variables `DOCKER_PREGISTRY_URL` (like <docker-registry-url>/<namespace-org>) and `PROJECT_NAME` (Cortex Project Name), and use build scripts to build and deploy.

##### On *nix systems
A Makefile is provided to do these steps.
* `export DOCKER_PREGISTRY_URL=<docker-registry-url>/<namespace-org>`
* `export PROJECT_NAME=<cortex-project>`
* `make all` will build and push Docker image, deploy Cortex Action and Skill, and then invoke Skill to test.

##### On Windows systems
A `make.bat` batch file is provided to do these steps.
* `set DOCKER_PREGISTRY_URL=<docker-registry-url>/<namespace-org>`
* `set PROJECT_NAME=<cortex-project>`
  > Below commands will build and push Docker image, deploy Cortex Action and Skill, and then invoke Skill to test.
* `make build`
* `make push`
* `make deploy`
* `make tests`

#### Guide to make changes as per the use case

1. Modify the main executable (`main.py` by default) run by the action image's entrypoint/command to handle the action's custom logic.
2. Modify the `requirements.txt` file to provide packages or libraries that the action requires.
3. Build the docker image (uses the `main.py` file)
  ```
  docker build -t <image-name>:<version> .
  ```
4. Push the docker image to a registry that is connected to your Kubernetes cluster.
  ```
  docker push <image-name>:<version>
  ```

  **(Optionally) Re-tag an image**
  ```
  docker tag <existing-image-name>:<existing-version> <new-image-name>:<new-version>
  ```
5. Deploy the action.
  ```
  cortex actions deploy --actionName <SKILL_NAME> \
  --actionType job \
  --docker <DOCKER_IMAGE> \
  --project <Project Name>
  ```
6. Modify the `skill.yaml` file.
7. Save/deploy the Skill.
  ```
  cortex skills save -y skill.yaml --project <Project Name>
  ```

   The Skill is added to the Cortex Fabric catalog and is available for selection when building interventions or Agents.

   Skills that are deployed may be invoked (run) either independently or within an agent.
